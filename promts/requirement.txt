I want to create mobile first web app
I will use 

react
vite
generouted
typescript
shadcn/ui
react-query
react-hook-form
supabase



My flow is 
daily around 8:00 am app asks mom how is shee feeling
mom will select one of few options ( raining, thunder, warm ... ). can also include text
depending on answer app will ask if she is in one of common problems she is facing
mom will select nearest situation to herself or input cutsom inputs
app will continue conversation with mom and conclude somewhere.

later app will let dad to know rough feeling of mom as emoji to father and ask his opinion.
and continue conversation with dad and conclude somewhere.

all conclusion will be used as later ai information.

later somewhere my app will suggest action to father.
for example: today is mom's day. but previously mom had this conversation maybe you should buy this.

opposite but same flow is possible too. starting from dad

app will learn from user interaction and keep data for later use. for example monthly summary or graph

For MVP AI will use OPENAI api. We will prepare prompt, adds user input and send to API. Promt can be edited from ADMIN UI

I will keep role in auth.users.app_metadata and sync it with public.profile.role via trigger
to make my ai is learning from past data. Will send past 7 day data summary to OPENAI api


understand and summerize this. I will ask you extra questions



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Now I am planning to create database on supabase. 

Give me main concepts and names of database tables i should create and relations. no need of fields for now. 

keep in mind i have role in public.profile's role field

since mom must have single dad we add relation directly to profile

i preffer prefix for tables. example instead of problem_master use m_problem

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Now give me sql to create all that for supabse.

include triggers
1. when user created sync auth.users.id to profile.id
2. when user created sync auth.users. raw_app_meta_data.role to profile.role

also include RLS

Give me single sql
